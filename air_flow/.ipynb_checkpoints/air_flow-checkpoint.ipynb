    "## What is airflow \n",
    "Airflow allows users to define, schedule, and monitor workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), which are collections of tasks with dependencies between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Airflow, workflows are represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).\n",
    "- DAGs consist of tasks and dependencies between them.\n",
    "- Tasks represent individual units of work to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operators:**\n",
    "- Tasks within a DAG are implemented using Operators.\n",
    "- Operators define what actually gets done by each task.\n",
    "- There are various built-in operators for common tasks like BashOperator for executing bash commands, PythonOperator for executing Python functions, etc.\n",
    "- You can also define custom operators to suit your specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Schedulers:**\n",
    "- Aas a scheduler component that orchestrates the execution of tasks based on their dependencies and schedule.\n",
    "- It continuously monitors all tasks and triggers the execution of tasks that are ready to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Executors:**\n",
    "- Executors determine how tasks are executed.\n",
    "- The most common executor is the SequentialExecutor, which runs tasks sequentially in a single process.\n",
    "- Other executors like LocalExecutor, CeleryExecutor, or KubernetesExecutor allow for distributed task execution."
