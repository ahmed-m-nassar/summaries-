    "### Pushing Branches from Local to GitHub\n",
    "##### Create a New Branch Locally:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use git checkout -b <branch-name> to create and switch to a new branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Make Your Changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify files, add new files, etc., as needed for your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Stage Your Changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use git add <file-name> for specific files or git add . to stage all changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Commit Your Changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Commit with git commit -m \"Your commit message\" to record your changes in the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Push the Branch to GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use git push origin <branch-name> to push your branch to the remote repository on GitHub.\n",
    "If it’s the first time you are pushing the branch, you might need to set the upstream branch with git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Pull Request on GitHub\n",
    "##### Navigate to the Repository on GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the GitHub repository where you pushed your branch.\n",
    "##### Start a New Pull Request:\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on 'Pull requests' tab and then click 'New pull request'.\n",
    "##### Select Your Branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the branch you pushed from the 'compare' dropdown.\n",
    "##### Review the Changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the diffs to ensure you are merging the correct changes.\n",
    "##### Create the Pull Request:\n",
    "\n",
    "Click 'Create pull request'. Provide a title and description for your pull request.\n",
    "##### Request Reviewers (Optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "You can request specific people to review your pull request.\n",
    "##### Respond to Feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "If reviewers provide feedback, make the necessary changes locally and push them to the same branch. The pull request will update automatically.\n",
    "##### Merge the Pull Request:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the pull request is approved and all checks (like automated tests) pass, you or a repository maintainer can merge it into the target branch (commonly the main or master branch).\n",
    "##### Delete the Branch (Optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "After merging, you have the option to delete the branch from the GitHub interface."
